# Installation
1. Clone GitHub repo to local machine.
2. Open Visual Studio Code (or comparable IDE) and run `npm install` in the terminal to install the packages (it may take awhile so be patient).
3. Once those have finished installing, run `npm run start` to start the web server. It can take a minute or so to open so give it time.
4. After it's done, it should open a web browser to the game. From there, you have a few options to run.
    1. Connect a VR Headset to your computer. The VR button should appear in the bottom right of the browser if you system detects a headset. Simply click it and the game will start within the headset.
    2. If you have a standalone headset (such as the Meta Quest 2), you can open the web browser on the headset and navigate to the URL (look at the browser open your computer). Don't forget to use https and not http, otherwise it won't load. Once you open the site on your headset, simply click the VR button on the bottom right to enter in VR mode.
